## Background

Welcome, friends, to Crucis. A world similar to our own in landscape but little else. Split into 6 large territories these lands provide opportunity and tragedy in equal parts. To the South East lies Contis, seat of the mighty Noan Republic whose power extends over most of the known world. Their lands are rife with political intrigue and as the centre of the largest power in the world many forces are at play within its borders. Baal Senators and Provincial governors plot and scheme to gain rank and favour to increase their power and influence over each other and the other races. Among the subservient Ko an organisation known as the Hulthaz trades in secrets and death and seeks to cause harm to the Baal for enslaving most of their race. Hidden in the shifting mountains of Kiksuz which straddle the centre of the continent lies the Acantha, Luamis who have escaped their slavery to live a life free from the rule of the Republic. On top of all this are some among the Baal who wish to rule themselves once more as they did before Noa came with its armies and forced them into submission.

To the west of Contis lies Aknaz, home of the Free Kunerga and the commerce and trade centre of the world. Only the best goods come from these islands and its said that its markets are so packed with stalls and shop fronts that they dwarf even great Noa herself. Among their merchants, and with trade routes and connections across the whole of Crucis, is the Gulthanan. A syndicate of wealthy merchants whose goal is to exploit any opportunity to make themselves richer and more powerful. “Anywhere there is profit you will find the Gulthanan and where ever they appear, profit will soon follow” is a common saying in Crucis. Their strength lies in the looseness of their ties and often times prominent members will be actively working against each other rather than together. Their protection of the Aknaz region and their alleged role in a multitude of assassinations of high ranking and prominent Noans long ago, now called the Night of Knives, has made Noa wary of them and were their bribes not so prolific they would have been destroyed long ago.

On the mainland the Campaigning legions have suffered huge loses after several rebellious factions have coalesced to form a united front in defiance of the Republic. Their numbers include Noan trained legions of Baal and Luamis who defected, agents of the Hulthaz who supply them with information and it is rumoured that members of the Gulthanan are funding their efforts and selling them provisions and arms. Most concerning of all is the help they have garnered from the mysterious Errolan, Giants from the canyons of Yaga-Ruun, to the north, whose lands no Noan army has ever set foot in, despite the numbers they have thrown against it. This rebellion has weakened Noa in the eyes of those who live under its rule and sparked many to fight for their freedom from its dominion. Throughout Haǯar the roaming Aghau of the Hara Mori are causing trouble and waylaying any who they come across and to the east the Dölra have begun retaking their lands from Noa. To the far west the Giggling priests of the isolationist Huldu still attack any who come close to their borders driving them insane with the potency of their chemicals and the maniacal laughter that follows them wherever they go.

In Aruna Rohe, the ancestral home of the Vodnik, many of the tribes have taken the emergence of the Coalition as an opportunity to claim their lands back from Noa and the marginalised Kake have organised to bring their once powerful kingdom back to its former glory while many of the tribes in Maha Pohaku and Ulu Timu are taking any chance they can to plunder and raid to gather as much resources as they can before Noa regains control.

This is the state of the world you are now in friends. The path you take is your own but chose your actions wisely as there are many forces at work in Crucis and who knows what outcome your actions will have.
