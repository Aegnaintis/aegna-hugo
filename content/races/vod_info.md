## Background

Life for the Vodnik, a frog like people native to the Aruna Rohe region, relies heavily on the care of various birthing pools. Called Waika Laia, these pools are where Vod lay their eggs and leave them to grow to infancy. Each pool usually nurtures the eggs of many surrounding villages and so throughout their history tribes have sought control of these vital locations. With this control comes the power to dictate how many offspring the surrounding tribes can have, if any, and so control the population of any who dare oppose them. Out of the tyranny that this brought about a religious order was born that now maintains many of the Waika Laia throughout Aruna Rohe.

The Hok Anago, as they are called now, developed ways of purifying the pools and even found ways of making previously poisoned or barren pools capable of nurturing the eggs of Vod. This knowledge is what allowed the Vod long ago to leave their ancestral home of Lakey Aina, colonising the whole of Aruna Rohe and taking the beliefs, and representatives, of the Hok with them. In those days the Hok were a powerful and structured religious order that were tasked with the care, defence and control of almost all the Waika Laia that had been established by the Vod.

As the years passed, the Hok's presence across all of Aruna Rohe as well as the inherent ability of their beliefs to vary greatly from one place to the next lead to huge differences in worship. The heavily structured nature it once had was lost over the vast distances it now occupied. In some areas, like Kake and much of Lakey Aina, the Hok have retained the power and systems that they had developed so long ago. While in others their role lost its religious component to became caretakers and defenders of the Waika Laia only. In still others they have lost many of the practical aspects of their role to become a mostly symbolic spiritual guide.

While the order of the Hok Anago may have lost much of its power, the beliefs they carried with them are still the dominant form of spiritualism for all Vod. It is easy to miss this fact, however, as their belief is a complex one. Ultimately they believe in Katomea, the World God who consumes itself to stay alive, but use of that name is quite uncommon in their worship. They believe that Katomea created the world from its own body and everything that is in the world is a part of it. Counted among the inhabitants of their world are many Demi-gods and Spirits, powerful beings that came from Katomea long ago and can influence or even control aspects of the world, like the weather or the oceans. These are the Gods that are commonly worshipped and they are as numerous as their worshippers, with every island and Waika Laia having its own collection of protectors and destroyers.

Beyond anything else the Vod are a practical people and whether this has been due to their religious beliefs, which unlike many other cultures does not involve sacrifices to the Gods, or if their religion mirrored their culture is unknown. The best examples of this practicality can be seen in the Matu'Opili, a mating festival that usually takes place every three years, and the Kanak Maa, their coming of age trial.

The Matu'Opili is perhaps the most ritualistic event that the Vod take part in and is when the next generation of eggs are laid. To an observer it could seem to be very ceremonial with the chosen males all joining in song while the females demonstrate their martial prowess in concert with the melodies created by the men. But almost every facet, from those chosen, to the demonstrations themselves, has a heavy element of practicality. The chosen pairs are often picked because their strengths are what the tribe desires in the next generation. While the displays, if impressive enough, can grant a village more space in the Waika Laia for their eggs, providing them with better standing.

The other major ritual of the Vod is the Kanak Maa, an often dangerous trial designed to prove a child is ready to become an adult of the tribe. Depending on the region a Vod is from this could range from slaying a fearsome creature of the sea or land to a race to collect some treasure or item from the den of a dangerous animal. In many of the forms of the trail it is conducted in female and male pairs and the focus is on the preparation and planning of the task as well as understanding the abilities and limits of both participants.

In Lakey Aina, for example, the trial is commonly a hunt where the male will build a Maga Komu, a small two person boat often used by the Vod, and then the pair will go out into the ocean where the female will hunt a creature of the sea. Once killed the pair will then bring it back to the tribe for a feast to celebrate their completion and step into adulthood. However, if the pair bring back a creature and are severely inured they are considered to have performed poorly in the trial no matter how large or fierce the creature was. This is seen as a sign of not understanding their own limits and lacking and understanding that a dead Vod cannot contribute to the tribe in any way.

Almost all Vod can essentially breath underwater through their skin, however this ability has a drawback as toxins can easily be introduced to their blood stream just by contact. They also have the ability to breath without the use of their lungs and so can continue a fight long after others would fall. Even the worst swimmers of the Vod still far exceed those of any other race and their lifestyles are often partially aquatic. This has made them reliant on water as the mucus they produce to protect their skin from taking in dirt and other contaminants is secreted constantly and uses a lot of water. This means that any Vod must pay particular attention to their hydration.

## The Boring Bits

Of all the races, the Vod are the most varied in appearance and while they generally share the same shape the abilities, colour and size of a Vod will change depending on which of the five regions of Aruna Rohe they are from. It is important to note that while maps will often show this division it was put in place by the Noan Republic when they conquered the region. With the exception of the Kake, the other regions are not and have never been united formally and two tribes living in a province will not necessarily be at peace or allied. This division was one of the main reasons why the Noans found success in their Conquest of Aruna Rohe.

### Lakey Aina

Those from the province of Lakey Aina are generally dark green on their backs and the tops of their head and have white streaks or dots across their backs. They also have golden eyes with horizontal slits for pupils. Other than their equals the Kake they are the best swimmers in all Crucis and very like the Kake they live much of their lives in the water, cultivating their Algae and seaweed farms as well as fishing and hunting in the depths of the ocean. The Aina see themselves as the true Vod and the progenitors of the rest of the race as it is generally agreed that their race began its life on the islands they inhabit and spread across all of Aruna Rohe. This general attitude has often kept their tribes apart from those in the other provinces and has made them suspicious of those that do not look the same as they them.

### The Plat

To the north and west of Lakey Aina are the two islands that make up Plat Mea. The Plat are the most physically different among the Vod and are the generally the largest of the Vod, they are primarily land dwellers and so their swimming ability is quite basic compared to other Vod, they are still better swimmers than most from the other races however. The Plat are a a brown or Tan colour with rough skin and their eyes are either black or grey with round pupils, they have large glands on their necks which secrete toxins, a hallucinogenic on the south island and a  poison on the north island. These toxins have no effect on the Plat whose bodies have adapted to the toxins their bodies produce but are enough to hamper those from other races who come into contact with them. Over the years the Plat have discovered many clever uses for these secretions and those that work with these substances are called the Luruga making medicines, poisons and drugs in equal measure and to the specifications required. Plat also have bone protrusions coming out of their feet called the Iriloika. Many worriers undergo a painful process to sharpen these protrusions into Irilau and in a fight these hidden blades can be very effective, especially if combined with the toxins the Plat produce.

### Kake

The only officially united province in the history of Aruna Rohe was the once great Kake empire. Its luscious and rich landscape made the tribes who called it home a target of the surrounding islands and so they banded together long ago into a nation. Believing themselves to be the perfect iteration of the Vod they saw the actions of those outside their borders as beneath them. This belief led them to a strange doctrine of violence in defence only which seemed to be very in line with the old traditions of the Hok Anago who indeed had the strongest and most structured presence here than anywhere else. Due to their abundant resources their population could grow freely and with this population growth came a more brutal way of life. Their Kanak Maa for instance directly pits the young against each other and those that survive are accepted as adults in the tribe. They were seen as extreme by the surrounding regions who did not often understand that their raids and piracy were what had caused this attitude. Now though their lands have been given to the surrounding tribes and their empire has lost its once formidable power.

The Kake are most similar in appearance to the Aina and are excellent swimmers and sailors who spend much of their time underwater and their Milky or light blue colouring helps them immensely in the water as it can act as a camouflage which combined with their prowess underwater is used to their great advantage. It is wise to assume if you are trespassing in their waters that their patrols could pop up at any moment and the last thing you will see are patterned gold eyes in the water.

### Maha Pohaku

To the South West of Kake is Maha Pohaku, a set of islands that was the first Vod Province to be conquered by the Noans. The hills and canyons that characterise this area made those that call it home into a strong and fierce group who have always had to fight to get what they need and be able to protect it once they had. Often seen as pirates they have difficult relations with many of the surrounding tribes and areas who they raid for resources. This raiding is what originally drew the attention of the Noan Republic and many Vod blame the tribes in that area for bring the the Noan's to their islands. While the Noan's would have inevitably attempted to conquer Aruna Rohe it was the ferocity of the Maha who beat them back more times than any other group has that ensured that the Vod did not suffer the same fate as the Kobold or the Luamis and were treated with respect rather than subjugation after they were conquered.

### The Maha

The Maha are often white or grey with black markings on their backs and grey eyes and Diamond shaped pupils. They have powerful legs and take huge leaps when needed. A common battle tactic of the tribes in this region is jumping right before engaging to get behind an enemy or using the power for a burst of speed that can be hard to control.

### Timu

Finally are the the most mysterious group among the Vod. Living largely on the island of Timu are many tribes whose abilities and colour follow no common thread other than they are undeniably Vod. Hidden in the rainforests on the island their culture and beliefs are largely a mystery though among the tribes that conduct trade with regions outside of Ulu Timu they seem to have a similar structure to other Vod in Aruna Rohe. Generally characterised by brighter coloured skin they usually identified by their lack of resemblance to any other group of Vod or possessing vastly different abilities than their cousins to the east. Of the many mutations that have been witnessed, many posses sticky nodes on their fingers and toes. Some have been seen to have almost transparent bodies, extra webbing on their toes and fingers that can be used to glide and poisonous mucus that are quite potent to touch.
