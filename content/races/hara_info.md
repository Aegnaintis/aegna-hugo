## Background

The Hara Mori are a race of centaurs that are native to Haǯar (pronounced Ha-jar) on the mainland. The life of the Hara Mori is usually split into two groups,  roaming hoards, or Aghau, and the villages who provide food for the Hoards, called Žolo (Jol-o). It is said that long ago two brothers had such enormous hoards at their command that resources began running out. The Brothers agreed that some of their people had to till the land and grow food for the rest of the Hara Mori, who would continue the true path of the Aghau. When the time came though they could not agree on which people should be barred from the proper life of the Hara Mori, each insisting that none of their own people would ever subject themselves to this fate and so a great war ensued. After many years of fighting the brothers agreed to meet in single combat with the victor leading the Aghau and the loser establishing the Žolo throughout Haǯar to feed them. Because of this the Žolo are often referred to as Hara Barl, the same name as a common horse in their language. Seen as existing for service to the hoards they are taken advantage of in much of Haǯar and most of their crops are given as tribute to the strongest Aghau in the region.

Like the Vodnik, the Hara Mori are not united and their division into four regions was imposed by Noa when they were conquered. Although treated as provinces and put under the rule of a Noan Governor the Aghau still operate much as they have in the past and the borders are constantly shifting between the different Warlords. In the centre of Haǯar lies Göbra (Go-Bra) and here the Hara are the closest to how they would have been in the old times. The Aghau roam and fight each other for territory while each  Žolo  pays tribute to the most powerful Warlord in the area and as long as tributes are paid the Aghau generally leave the Žolo alone. This is also the province that has most adapted to the control of Noa and were the first of their kind to submit to her rule.

In the forests of Hojra, however, there are plenty of resources and so Žolo are less relied on, established more as way points than anything else. Because they are less relied on, the Aghau usually see no harm in pillaging any Žolo they come across and so the inhabitants can often have their own militias or army. The Hojra have lithe bodies and are extremely agile in their forests, here more than anywhere else in  Haǯar warfare can be a way of life with skirmishes between Aghau, Žolo and the isolationist Huldu, who they share a border with, almost an every day occurrence. The abundance in resources means that the numbers of the Hojra are relatively large which also contributes to the aggressiveness they are known for.

To the west is Dölra and the inhabitants of this region are generally the largest of the Hara Mori. They are also the only area to have formal borders, split into four areas again, each region is controlled by an Aghau and while not exactly peaceful these regions are the most stable in all of  Haǯar. The four Aghau are known for their different Susori, a coming of age ritual, and while this ritual is common across  Haǯar the relative power and size of Hara Mori in other parts of the region are considerably smaller than in Dölra, whose Aghau are many times the size of the other Aghau in  Haǯar.

The Dölra are the only Hara Mori to not consider metal armour cowardly or ineffective and they use their armour to great effect. The Kujrag hunt Catoblepas and make armour from their scaled pelts while the Čira-Aru are presented their armour and must stand against a stampede of Yale. Not all the Susori deal with armour though as the Ababug Susori involves attacking a nest of Čibug and claiming prizes from these monstrosities , they believe their purpose is to hold back these creatures who feign at intelligence. And the Sarga believe that you must hunt dangerous animals and prove that you are strong without the armour before you may be presented with it.

Smallest of the Hara Mori are those living in Čagra, a frigid and desolate land in the North western most corner of Crucis. With thick coats and stout bodies the inhabitants of this land became experts at living in balance with natural resources and live an entirely nomadic life with very little conflict between the different Aghau. These days though their land is a a constant battlefield with Noa having set its eyes on their lands as its next conquest and the Coalition of the resistance against Noa having formed in its frozen wastes. Now to be a Hara Mori from this land is almost the same as being in direct opposition to the Republic.

Perhaps Paradoxically, the major belief the Hara Mori share is represented in the Tewke. A vast Aghau that enjoys protection from the attack of all others of their kind, the Tewke are the past men and they are obsessed with the collection and recording of history. They believe that the world works in Cycles and that by collecting information on current and past events they can find the common threads to predict the future. Commonly consulted on matters of the Self, Season or lifetime they believe and specialise in different levels of the Cycles that extend from a day cycle to a view of the entire world and past worlds that have existed. Their belief does not specify gods or deities however it is common among the Aghau in particular to Deify great heroes and dedicate victories or achievements to great Mori from the past.

## The Boring Parts

The Hara Mori are a centaur race that commonly only lives to be 30-40 years old but they develop far quicker than any other race as their age of maturation is around 5 years old. With fur covering their entire body, including the humanoid half, and their face is almost a halfway point between human and horse with a nose and mouth that protrude from the main part of the face. Their hair usually extends like the mane of a horse up the back of their torso and over their head. The most common coat colors of Hara Mori are Gray in Čagra, Chestnut in Hojra and Göbra and Bay in Dölra. Though these are the common coat colours this does not mean that they are the only colours and a wide variety can be seen within these categories and even beyond (really any colour a horse can be). The size of the Hara Mori depends of where in their lands they come from, ranging from around 200cm in Čagra to 300cm in Dölra and around 250cm in Hojra and Göbra.
