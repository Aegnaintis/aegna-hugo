## Background

The Story of the Kunerga is a sad tale of how the strong can trample the weak and has left the majority of their race as nothing more than property. Originating in the shifting mountains of Kiksuz the Goblin like Kunerga are the smallest of the races in Crucis by far. In their homelands this size was a benefit to them as food and resources were hard to come by and their small bodies needed less food to keep going. They possess incredible eyes which can pick out the finest of details and see shades and colours that ours cannot and have long and nimble fingers which they can use to craft the most astonishing works. The combination of these two factors has led to their dominating the crafting industries and Kunerga wares are considered the best in Crucis.

Much of the history of the Kunerga was lost when they were conquered by the Noan's, who then made slaves of almost their entire race. During this time much of their culture was forbidden by their new masters and what survived were the whispers of those brave enough to keep their culture alive at the risk of their own lives. It was, however, changed over the years and there is little doubt that it only barely resembles its original form. This is not the case everywhere though, as some escaped enslavement by Noa and found a new home in Aknaz which, using their talent for creation, they turned into the trade and crafting centre of Crucis.

There are now two main groups of Kunerga, those that are free are often found in Aknaz and the Ko, those that are still enslaved, can be found throughout Crucis waiting on their masters. To these masters, the Ko are nothing but property to be owned, used and discarded of when they can no longer work. Some lucky few have earned their freedom from generous masters but with their freedom they lose their safety and it is not uncommon for a recently freed Ko to find themselves kidnapped and sold back into the slavery they had just escaped. Because of this many Ko who gain freedom seek out any wealthy and protected Kunerga or attempt to book passage to Aknaz where they will not have to face the prospect of being owned.

The physical weakness of the Kunerga has worked in the favour of the Hulthaz, a mysterious network of spies and assassins who seem to have eyes and ears everywhere. Usually hiding behind a fa√ßade of meek slavery,  on the few occasions they have acted overtly they have shaken Crucis and in particular the Noan Republic. Now they are talked about in many places but mostly in rumours and hearsay. The true sign of someone who has dealt with them is often the uncovering of their body after their use has expired.

Among the free Kunerga in Aknaz another type of organisation grew, a loose alliance of merchants and the wealthy who use their money and influence to shape Crucis to their desires. The Gulthanan was originally a council of the richest free Kunerga who met to discuss issues they all faced, namely the impending threat of Noa. In Modern times however it has grown substantially and many wealthy merchants brag about being among their numbers though more commonly they have the patronage of a true member of the inner council. Their bribes and influence are so prolific that they have even dictated the course of Noa's mighty Republic at times and many among their council have Senators, Legates and at other times Consuls under their thumb.

## The Boring Bits

The Kunerga are a small Goblin like race that are largely humanoid with arms that hang down past their waist and long fingers. Their skin is a light grey green colour and they have large bulbous heads, usually without any hair. They have exceptional hearing from their large ears which are long and come to a sharp point at the back, some have fan like flaps that hang down off these ears as well. The Vision of a Kunerga is excellent and they can see shades and colours that no other race on Crucis can. Their eyes are usually either Black, Red or Orange and are large in their heads as well. The average height for a Kunerga is ~120cm for both sexes which makes them the smallest of the races by far. Due to the environment that the Kunerga originated in they evolved to need far less food and water than any other race and so can survive quite easily off of very little sustenance.

## Unique Roles

* Staibon (Rock priest)
* Artificer of Aknaz

## Common Weapons

* Often use smaller and lighter weapons like knives (which for their size can essentially be swords).  
* Many Kunerga from Aknaz carry miniature hand axes or blades.
